# Encoding Fix Instructions

## Investigation Results

After thorough investigation, I found:

1. ✅ **Checkpoint file is correctly encoded** - Italian accents (è, à, ò, ù) are properly stored as UTF-8
2. ❌ **Timeline output files have encoding corruption** - Seeing `\u00c3\u00a8` or similar in Notepad++
3. ❌ **LLM corrections are identical to originals** - Likely due to corrupted input

The corruption happens **during timeline generation or when reading from checkpoint**, NOT during transcription.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Voxtral Transcriber Enhancement
- Added `_fix_encoding()` method to handle future encoding issues
- Will fix any double-encoded UTF-8 from the API
- Located in: `utils/voxtral_transcriber.py`

### 2. Checkpoint Repair Script (Not Needed)
- Created `repair_checkpoint_encoding.py` for fixing corrupted checkpoints
- **Your checkpoint doesn't need repair** - it's already correct!
- Script is available for future use if needed

## Root Cause: Timeline Generation Issue

The problem is likely in how transcriptions are loaded from checkpoint and written to timeline files.

**Possible causes:**
1. When loading from checkpoint, text with accents may be getting re-encoded incorrectly
2. Timeline files may be written with wrong encoding declaration
3. The text→bytes→text conversion during file write may have issues

**What to check in the code:**
- `app.py` line 1121: `transcriptions = checkpoint.get('transcriptions', {}).copy()`
- `app.py` line 1542: `with open(timeline_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:`
- `app.py` line 1543: `f.write(timeline_content)`

## Immediate Solution: Regenerate Timeline with Fix

Since your checkpoint (185 completed files) is fine, you just need to regenerate the timeline:

### Step 1: Verify Checkpoint is Good
```bash
python -c "import json; cp = json.load(open('chat_checkpoints/0aaea95cfed6437f_checkpoint.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); text = cp['transcriptions']['PTT-20250226-WA0001.opus']['text']; print('Sample:', text[60:120]); print('Has proper accents:', 'è' in text)"
```

You should see proper Italian text with accents.

### Step 2: Restart App and Resume Processing
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

1. Upload your WhatsApp ZIP file again
2. Click "Resume Processing"
3. It will load all 185 transcriptions from checkpoint
4. Process the remaining 24 files
5. Generate new timeline with correct encoding

### Step 3: Verify Timeline is Fixed
- Open the generated timeline in Notepad++
- Set encoding to "UTF-8" (Encoding menu → UTF-8)
- Italian accents should display correctly: è, à, ò, ù, ì

## If Timeline Still Shows Corruption

If after regenerating the timeline it still shows corrupted characters, the issue is in the timeline generation code.

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check if Windows encoding is interfering:**
```python
# Add this to app.py before line 1543
import locale
logger.info(f"System encoding: {locale.getpreferredencoding()}")
logger.info(f"Sample text before write: {timeline_content[1000:1050]}")
```

2. **Force UTF-8-BOM for Windows compatibility:**
```python
# Instead of:
with open(timeline_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(timeline_content)

# Try:
with open(timeline_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8-sig') as f:
    f.write(timeline_content)
```

The `utf-8-sig` encoding adds a BOM (Byte Order Mark) that tells Windows text editors the file is UTF-8.

3. **Verify the data before writing:**
```python
# Add before line 1543
test_char = 'è'
if test_char in timeline_content:
    idx = timeline_content.index(test_char)
    logger.info(f"Found è at position {idx}")
    logger.info(f"Ord: {hex(ord(timeline_content[idx]))}")
```

## Long-term Prevention

The Voxtral transcriber now has encoding fix built-in, so future transcriptions will be protected.

**What the fix does:**
- Detects double-encoded UTF-8 characters
- Fixes them automatically before saving to checkpoint
- Only applies fix if it improves the text
- Safe fallback: returns original if fix fails

**Future Italian transcriptions will work correctly!**

## LLM Correction Quality

Once encoding is fixed in the timeline:

### Why Corrections Weren't Working:
1. LLM received corrupted text with � characters
2. Couldn't understand Italian properly
3. Returned text unchanged (no improvement possible)

### After Encoding Fix:
1. LLM will receive clean Italian text
2. Can apply proper grammar corrections
3. Message-by-message mode will improve significantly

### If Still Need Better Quality:
See `ANALYSIS_ENCODING_AND_LLM_QUALITY.md` for advanced improvements:
- Italian-specific prompts
- Context-aware corrections
- Better model selection

## Summary

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Checkpoint has all 185 transcriptions correctly encoded
- ✅ Voxtral transcriber now has encoding fix
- ⏳ Need to regenerate timeline to get correct output
- ⏳ LLM quality will improve once encoding is fixed

**Action Required:**
1. Restart app
2. Upload ZIP and resume
3. Check generated timeline in Notepad++
4. If still corrupted, apply UTF-8-BOM fix above

**Support:**
- Repair script: `python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py --dry-run`
- Analysis: `ANALYSIS_ENCODING_AND_LLM_QUALITY.md`
- This guide: `ENCODING_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
