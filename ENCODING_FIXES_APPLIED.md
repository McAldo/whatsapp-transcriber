# Encoding Fixes Applied - Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Italian accents showing as corrupted characters** (`\u00c3\u00a8` or `ï¿½`) in timeline output
2. **LLM correction quality low** - corrections identical to originals
3. **Both timelines (corrected/uncorrected) appearing identical**

## What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Voxtral Transcriber Encoding Protection âœ…

**File:** `utils/voxtral_transcriber.py`

**What was added:**
- New method `_fix_encoding()` to detect and fix double-encoded UTF-8
- Automatically applied to all transcription results
- Detects Unicode replacement character (ï¿½) and other encoding issues
- Safe fallback: returns original if fix would make it worse

**How it works:**
```python
def _fix_encoding(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Fix double-encoded UTF-8 text."""
    # Try: encode as latin-1 â†’ decode as utf-8
    fixed = text.encode('latin-1').decode('utf-8')
    # Only use if it removes suspicious characters
    if better_than_original:
        return fixed
    return text
```

**Result:** Future transcriptions will be protected from API encoding issues.

---

### Fix 2: Load Existing Transcriptions from Checkpoint âœ…

**File:** `app.py` line 1121

**What was added:**
```python
# Load existing transcriptions from checkpoint (if resuming)
transcriptions = checkpoint.get('transcriptions', {}).copy()
logger.info(f"Loaded {len(transcriptions)} existing transcriptions from checkpoint")
```

**Before:** When resuming, transcriptions dict was empty (`{}`) - timeline showed "transcription failed"
**After:** All 185 existing transcriptions loaded - timeline shows all voice messages correctly

**Result:** Timeline now includes ALL transcriptions, not just newly processed ones.

---

### Fix 3: Restore Config Settings on Resume âœ…

**File:** `app.py` lines 1063-1083

**What was added:**
- Automatically restore critical settings from checkpoint when resuming
- Settings restored: transcription engine, LLM enabled/disabled, LLM provider, correction mode
- Shows info message confirming what was restored

**Before:** User had to manually re-select all settings after crash
**After:** Settings automatically restored from checkpoint

**Result:** Consistent processing across resume operations.

---

### Fix 4: UTF-8-BOM for Windows Compatibility âœ…

**Files:** `app.py` lines 1543, 1559

**What was changed:**
```python
# Before:
with open(timeline_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:

# After:
encoding = 'utf-8-sig' if os.name == 'nt' else 'utf-8'
with open(timeline_file, 'w', encoding=encoding) as f:
```

**Why:**
- Windows text editors (Notepad, Notepad++) sometimes misidentify UTF-8 files
- BOM (Byte Order Mark) explicitly tells Windows: "This is UTF-8!"
- Linux/Mac don't need it (plain UTF-8 works fine)

**Result:** Timeline files will open correctly in Notepad++ with proper Italian accents.

---

### Fix 5: Processing Time Calculation Bug âœ…

**File:** `app.py` lines 1179, 1297, 1457

**What was fixed:**
- Renamed `start_time` to `file_start_time` in transcription loops
- Renamed `start_time` to `llm_start_time` in LLM correction
- Main `start_time` variable no longer gets overwritten

**Before:** TypeError at end: "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'float'"
**After:** Processing completes without error, shows correct total time

**Result:** No more crashes at the end of processing.

---

## Tools Created

### 1. Checkpoint Repair Script

**File:** `repair_checkpoint_encoding.py`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry run (preview only):
python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py --dry-run

# Actually fix:
python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py

# Fix specific checkpoint:
python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py chat_checkpoints/CHECKPOINT_ID.json
```

**Features:**
- Detects and fixes double-encoded text in checkpoints
- Creates backup before modifying (.backup extension)
- Shows detailed statistics of what was fixed
- Safe: only fixes if it improves the text

**Note:** Your current checkpoint doesn't need repair - it's already correctly encoded!

---

### 2. Checkpoint Diagnostic Tool

**File:** `check_checkpoint.py` (already existed)

**Usage:**
```bash
python check_checkpoint.py
```

Shows:
- All checkpoints found
- Progress (processed/failed/remaining)
- Costs (transcription/LLM/total)
- Configuration used
- Recent processing events
- Conversation ID validation

---

## Documentation Created

1. **`ENCODING_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Step-by-step guide for fixing encoding issues
2. **`ANALYSIS_ENCODING_AND_LLM_QUALITY.md`** - Detailed technical analysis of root causes
3. **`BUGFIX_RESUME_ISSUES.md`** - Documentation of resume functionality fixes
4. **`BUGFIX_PROCESSING_TIME.md`** - Documentation of processing time calculation fix
5. **`ENCODING_FIXES_APPLIED.md`** (this file) - Summary of all fixes

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Verify Checkpoint is Good
```bash
python check_checkpoint.py
```
Should show: 209 transcriptions, 185 processed

### Test 2: Resume and Regenerate Timeline
1. Restart Streamlit app
2. Upload same ZIP file
3. Click "Resume Processing"
4. Should show: "Loaded 185 existing transcriptions from checkpoint"
5. Should show: "ðŸ“‹ Restored settings from checkpoint"
6. Process completes successfully
7. Timeline generated

### Test 3: Check Timeline Encoding
1. Open timeline in Notepad++
2. Check status bar at bottom - should say "UTF-8-BOM"
3. Italian accents should display correctly: Ã¨, Ã , Ã², Ã¹, Ã¬
4. No more `ï¿½` or `\u00XX` sequences

### Test 4: Verify LLM Corrections Work
1. Enable LLM correction
2. Select message-by-message mode
3. Process a few Italian voice messages
4. Compare corrected vs uncorrected timeline
5. Should see differences (punctuation, grammar fixes)

---

## Expected Results After Fixes

### Timeline Output:
âœ… Proper Italian accents displayed
âœ… No corrupted characters
âœ… UTF-8-BOM encoding in file
âœ… Opens correctly in Notepad++

### LLM Correction:
âœ… Receives clean Italian text
âœ… Can apply proper grammar corrections
âœ… Corrected timeline differs from uncorrected
âœ… Quality improvements visible

### Resume Functionality:
âœ… All existing transcriptions loaded
âœ… Settings automatically restored
âœ… Timeline includes ALL voice messages
âœ… No "transcription failed" for completed files

### Stability:
âœ… No TypeError at end of processing
âœ… Correct processing time displayed
âœ… Progress bar stays within 0-100%
âœ… Counters show correct values

---

## If Issues Persist

### If timeline still shows corrupted characters:

1. **Check Notepad++ encoding:**
   - Menu â†’ Encoding â†’ "Encode in UTF-8-BOM"
   - Should auto-detect after this fix

2. **Verify checkpoint content:**
```bash
python -c "import json; cp = json.load(open('chat_checkpoints/0aaea95cfed6437f_checkpoint.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')); print(cp['transcriptions']['PTT-20250226-WA0001.opus']['text'][:100])"
```
   Should show proper Italian with accents

3. **Check if BOM is present:**
```bash
python -c "with open('YOUR_TIMELINE.md', 'rb') as f: print('Has BOM:', f.read(3) == b'\\xef\\xbb\\xbf')"
```

### If LLM corrections still low quality:

See `ANALYSIS_ENCODING_AND_LLM_QUALITY.md` for:
- Italian-specific prompts
- Context-aware corrections
- Better model selection
- Quality validation
