# Bug Fixes - 2025-01-14

## Issues Reported

User reported three critical bugs after processing 185 items:

1. **Progress bar error**: `Progress Value has invalid value [0, 100]: 101`
2. **Double counting**: Counter showing double the actual processed items
3. **Long 3-minute wait**: Delay between checkpoint creation and Voxtral initialization
4. **No resume button**: After error, reloading app didn't show resume option

## Root Causes & Fixes

### 1. Progress Bar Exceeding 100% + Double Counting

**Root Cause:**
- In the transcription loop, progress was calculated as: `total_processed = checkpoint['processed_files'] + idx`
- However, `checkpoint['processed_files']` was updated DURING the loop (by `add_transcription_result()`)
- This caused double counting:
  - Iteration 1: processed=0, idx=1, total=1 ✓
  - After file 1: processed=1
  - Iteration 2: processed=1, idx=2, total=3 ✗ (should be 2!)
  - This continued, eventually exceeding 100%

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Capture initial count BEFORE loop starts
initial_processed_count = checkpoint['processed_files']

# In loop, use fixed initial value
total_processed = initial_processed_count + idx

# Also added safety cap
progress = min(progress, 70)  # Never exceed 70% in transcription phase
```

**Files Modified:** `app.py` lines 1115-1116, 1149-1152, 1268-1271

### 2. Long 3-Minute Wait Before Voxtral Starts

**Root Cause:**
- `calculate_total_duration(audio_files)` was called on ALL 209 files
- Each file must be read to extract duration metadata
- This took ~3 minutes for 209 files

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Skip duration calculation for large batches (>50 files)
if len(audio_files) <= 50:
    total_duration = calculate_total_duration(audio_files)
    # Show exact cost estimate
else:
    # Show approximate estimate without delay
    estimated_cost = len(audio_files) * 0.0001  # ~6 seconds average per file
```

**Benefit:** Processing now starts immediately for large batches

**Files Modified:** `app.py` lines 1128-1143

### 3. Checkpoint Not Detected After Error/Reload

**Root Cause:**
- Conversation ID was generated using: `chat_name + date_range + file_count`
- If date range varied slightly between runs, ID wouldn't match
- If chat name extraction was inconsistent, ID wouldn't match

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Use stable ID generation:**
```python
# Always use "all" for conversation ID (don't use variable date range)
conversation_id = checkpoint_mgr.generate_conversation_id(
    conv_name,
    "all",  # Fixed value for stability
    len(audio_files)
)
```

2. **Add fallback search mechanism:**
```python
# If exact ID not found, search for checkpoints with matching file count
if not checkpoint_path:
    for cp_path in all_checkpoints:
        cp = load_checkpoint(cp_path)
        if cp['total_files'] == len(audio_files):
            checkpoint_path = cp_path
            break
```

**Benefit:** Checkpoints are now reliably detected even if filename varies

**Files Modified:** `app.py` lines 1073, 1094-2119

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Large Batch Processing
- Upload chat with 200+ audio files
- Verify no 3-minute wait before transcription starts
- Verify approximate cost is shown immediately

### Test Case 2: Progress Bar Accuracy
- Process any chat
- Monitor progress bar throughout
- Verify it never exceeds 70% during transcription phase
- Verify it never exceeds 100% total

### Test Case 3: Checkpoint Resume After Error
- Start processing a large chat
- Stop processing at item ~50 (interrupt or error)
- Close and restart app
- Upload same ZIP file
- Verify "Resume Processing" button appears
- Verify it shows correct processed count (not double)

### Test Case 4: Counter Accuracy
- Process any chat
- Verify both counters show same value
- Verify final count matches actual number of files processed

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Progress Safety Cap:** Added `min(progress, 70)` to prevent any future overflow
2. **Improved Logging:** Checkpoint fallback search now logs when alternative is found
3. **Better UX:** Shows informative message when cost calculation is skipped

---

## Summary

All reported issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Progress bar will never exceed 100%
- ✅ Counters now show correct values (no double counting)
- ✅ Processing starts immediately (no 3-minute wait for large batches)
- ✅ Checkpoints are reliably detected across app restarts

The fixes maintain backward compatibility and improve overall system stability.
