---

### Step 3: Process Your Chat

Now the fun part! Here's how to transcribe your chat:

**1. Upload Your File**
   - Click "Browse files" or drag-and-drop your ZIP file
   - Wait a moment while it loads

**2. Preview Your Chat** (Optional)
   - See conversation name, participants, date range
   - View how many messages and voice messages
   - Filter by date if needed

**3. Configure Settings**

   **Transcription Model** (How accurate?)
   - **Recommended:** "base" - Fast and accurate for most people
   - If unclear audio: Try "small" or "medium" (slower but better)
   - Testing/fast preview: "tiny" (quickest but basic quality)

   **Output Format** (How do you want to read it?)
   - **Recommended:** Markdown (.md) - Beautiful formatting
   - Plain Text (.txt) - Simple, works anywhere
   - CSV (.csv) - Open in Excel
   - JSON (.json) - For programmers

   - Fixes errors, adds punctuation, improves readability
   - See "AI Enhancement" section below for details

**4. Click "Process Chat"**

     - Which model you chose
     - Your computer speed
   - Typical chat with 50 voice messages: 5-10 minutes

**5. Download Your Results**
   - **Timeline file** - Your transcribed conversation
   - **Media ZIP** - All photos, videos, and files organized

**Done!** You now have a fully transcribed, searchable record of your conversation!

---

## What If Processing Gets Interrupted?

**Don't worry - your progress is automatically saved!**

### How the Checkpoint System Works

The app saves your progress automatically after every voice message is transcribed. If something goes wrong (computer crashes, you accidentally close the app, power outage, etc.), you can easily resume where you left off.

### How to Resume Processing

1. **Restart the app**
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload the SAME ZIP file** you used before
   - Must be the exact same file
   - App recognizes it by chat name and file count

3. **Look for the Resume Button**
   - You'll see a yellow warning box: "‚ö†Ô∏è Previous processing found for this chat"
   - Shows how many files were already processed
   - Shows costs so far
   - Shows when it was last processed

4. **Three options appear:**
   - **Resume Processing** - Continue from where you stopped (recommended)
   - **Start Fresh** - Discard previous work and start over
   - **Retry Failed Files** - Only re-process files that failed

5. **Click "Resume Processing"**
   - App skips files already completed
   - Your settings (transcription engine, LLM options) are automatically restored
   - Processing continues from the next unprocessed file

### What Gets Saved in Checkpoints?

- ‚úÖ All completed transcriptions
- ‚úÖ Your configuration (transcription engine, LLM settings, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Cost tracking (transcription and LLM costs)
- ‚úÖ Which files succeeded and which failed
- ‚úÖ Processing log with timestamps

### Where Are Checkpoints Stored?

Checkpoints are saved in a folder called `chat_checkpoints/` in your app directory. Each conversation gets its own checkpoint file.

**You can safely delete checkpoints** when you're done with a chat and don't need to resume anymore.

### Example Scenario

**Situation:** You start processing a large group chat with 200 voice messages. After completing 150 transcriptions (75% done), your computer crashes.

**What happens:**
1. You restart your computer
2. Start the app again
3. Upload the same ZIP file
4. App shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Previous processing found: 150/200 files completed"
5. Click "Resume Processing"
6. App processes only the remaining 50 files
7. **You saved ~30 minutes and avoided re-processing 150 files!**

### Troubleshooting Resume

**"Resume button doesn't appear"**
- Make sure you uploaded the exact same ZIP file
- Check that `chat_checkpoints/` folder exists
- Run `python check_checkpoint.py` to see if checkpoint exists

**"Want to see checkpoint details"**
- Run: `python check_checkpoint.py`
- Shows all checkpoints, progress, costs, and status

**"Characters look corrupted (√® shows as ÔøΩ)"**
- Run: `python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py --dry-run`
- This will check and fix encoding issues
- Remove `--dry-run` to actually fix the checkpoint

## Understanding AI Enhancement (Optional)

AI Enhancement makes transcriptions more readable by fixing errors and adding punctuation. **This is completely optional** - your basic transcription works great without it!

### Why Use AI Enhancement?

**Before AI Enhancement:**
```
hey how are you doing um i wanted to ask you about that thing we talked about yesterday you know the project thing
```

**After AI Enhancement:**
```

```

Much more readable!

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Best Transcription Quality

**‚úÖ Do's:**
- Use "base" or "small" model for good quality
- Keep original audio files (don't compress)
- Use "Auto-detect" for language (it's smart!)
- Let it process completely (don't close browser)

**‚ùå Don'ts:**
- Don't use "tiny" model for important chats (quality suffers)
- Don't process during other heavy tasks (slows down)
- Don't close the app while processing (will lose progress)

### Processing Large Conversations

**If you have a huge chat (5000+ messages):**

1. **Use date filtering** - Process in smaller chunks
   - This month
   - Last month
   - Previous months separately

2. **Start with a small test**
   - Filter to just last 7 days first
   - Make sure settings are right
   - Then process larger ranges

3. **Be patient**
   - Large chats take time (30-60+ minutes)
   - Progress bar shows status
   - Let your computer focus on this task

4. **Don't worry about interruptions**
   - Progress is automatically saved
   - You can resume anytime
   - Even close the app and come back later

### Saving Money on AI (If Using Paid Options)

**1. Test without AI first**
   - Process without AI enhancement
   - See if quality is already good enough
   - Only add AI if needed

**2. Use bulk mode**
   - For chats under 50 messages
   - Saves 70% on API costs
   - Much faster too

**3. Filter to what you need**
   - Don't process entire 2-year chat
   - Pick the specific months you need

**4. Consider Ollama (Free!)**
   - One-time 10-minute setup
   - Free forever after that
   - Quality is quite good

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find chat file in ZIP"

**Problem:** App can't find your WhatsApp messages

**Solution:**
- Make sure you exported from WhatsApp (not just copied files)
- Make sure you chose "Include Media" or "Attach Media"
- Try exporting again
- Check the ZIP file contains a `_chat.txt` file

---

### Processing is Very Slow

**Problem:** Transcription taking forever

**Possible causes & solutions:**

**1. Using CPU instead of GPU**
   - Do you have an NVIDIA graphics card?
   - Check if app says "CPU" in the status
   - See "Enable GPU Acceleration" section in README
   - **Quick fix:** Use a smaller model (tiny or base)

**2. Large model on slow computer**
   - Using "medium" or "large" model?
   - **Solution:** Switch to "base" (still good quality!)

**3. Many voice messages**
   - 100+ voice messages takes time (20-40 minutes)
   - This is normal!
   - Use date filtering to process fewer messages

---

### "Characters look weird (√® shows as ÔøΩ or strange codes)"

**Problem:** Italian or other language accents not displaying correctly

**Solution:**
1. **Open timeline in proper text editor:**
   - Use Notepad++ (Windows) - Set encoding to "UTF-8-BOM"
   - Use TextEdit (Mac) - Should auto-detect
   - Use VS Code - Set encoding to "UTF-8 with BOM"

2. **If problem persists in checkpoint:**
   ```bash
   # Check for encoding issues
   python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py --dry-run

   # Fix the checkpoint
   python repair_checkpoint_encoding.py
   ```

3. **Regenerate timeline:**
   - Resume processing (will use fixed checkpoint)
   - New timeline will have correct characters

---

### "I accidentally closed the app during processing!"

**Problem:** Processing was interrupted

**Solution:**
1. **Don't panic** - Your progress is saved!
2. **Restart the app:**
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. **Upload the same ZIP file**
4. **Click "Resume Processing"** when the button appears
5. Processing continues from where it stopped

**Your completed transcriptions are safe!**

---

### "Resume button doesn't appear but I know I was processing this chat"

**Problem:** Checkpoint exists but not detected

**Solutions:**

**1. Check if checkpoint exists:**
```bash
python check_checkpoint.py
```
This shows all saved checkpoints and their status

**2. Make sure you uploaded the exact same ZIP file**
- Same file, not a new export
- File name can be different, but contents must match

**3. Check chat name:**
- If WhatsApp added (2), (3) to filename, it might not match
- The diagnostic tool above will show the chat name in checkpoint

**4. Manual recovery (advanced):**
- Check `chat_checkpoints/` folder
- Your transcriptions are saved in JSON format
- Can be manually extracted if needed

---

### App Won't Start / "Error installing"

**Problem:** Can't run the app or installation failed

**Solutions:**

**1. Python not installed correctly**
   ```
   python --version
   ```

   If not: Reinstall Python, check "Add to PATH"

**2. Installation failed**
   Try:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

**3. Windows: Microsoft Visual C++ required**
   - Download from [Microsoft](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
   - Install and restart computer

---

### "Out of Memory" Error

**Problem:** Computer runs out of memory during processing

**Solutions:**

**1. Use smaller model**
   - Switch from "large" ‚Üí "medium" ‚Üí "small" ‚Üí "base"
   - "Base" uses only ~2 GB memory

**2. Close other programs**
   - Close browser tabs
   - Close video games
   - Close other memory-heavy apps

**3. Process in smaller chunks**
   - Use date filtering
   - Process one month at a time

---

### AI Enhancement Not Working

**Problem:** Ollama connection failed or API key rejected

**Solutions for Ollama:**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# If not running, start Ollama app

# Make sure model is downloaded
ollama pull llama3.2

# Test it works
ollama run llama3.2 "Hello"
```

**Solutions for Cloud AI (Claude/OpenAI/Mistral):**
- Double-check API key (no extra spaces)
- Check you added payment method to account

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data safe? Where do my messages go?**

A: By default, **everything stays on your computer**. Voice messages are transcribed locally, nothing is uploaded. Only if you enable AI enhancement with Claude/OpenAI/Mistral, the transcribed TEXT (not audio) is sent to their servers for correction. Using Ollama keeps everything 100% local.

---

**Q: How long does it take to process?**

A: Depends on:
- **10 voice messages:** ~2-5 minutes
- **50 voice messages:** ~10-15 minutes
