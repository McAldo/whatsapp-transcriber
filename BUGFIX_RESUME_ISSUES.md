# Bug Fixes - Resume Functionality Issues (2025-01-14)

## Issues Reported

User reported two issues after successfully resuming processing:

1. **Timeline showing "transcription failed"**: Despite all transcriptions completing successfully, the final timeline displayed "transcription failed" for every voice message
2. **Settings not carried over**: When resuming processing, the app didn't restore settings from the previous attempt (e.g., whether LLM correction was enabled, correction mode, etc.)

## Issue 1: Timeline Showing "Transcription Failed"

### Root Cause

When resuming from a checkpoint, the existing transcriptions were never loaded from the checkpoint into the working memory.

**The Problem:**
- Line 1120: `transcriptions = {}` created an empty dictionary
- During fresh processing, this dict is populated as files are transcribed (lines 1218, 1336)
- However, when resuming:
  - The checkpoint contains all previously completed transcriptions (185 files in user's case)
  - These were never loaded into the `transcriptions` dict
  - Only newly processed files (24 files) were added
  - Timeline generation received incomplete dict missing 185 files

**What Happened:**
```python
# User processed 185 files â†’ saved in checkpoint.transcriptions
# App crashed, user resumed
# Line 1120: transcriptions = {}  # Empty! Lost the 185 files
# Processed 24 new files â†’ added to transcriptions
# Timeline generation: Only has 24 files, missing 185
# For those 185 files: shows "transcription failed"
```

### Fix Applied

**Location:** `app.py` lines 1120-1122

```python
# BEFORE:
transcriptions = {}

# AFTER:
# Load existing transcriptions from checkpoint (if resuming)
transcriptions = checkpoint.get('transcriptions', {}).copy()
logger.info(f"Loaded {len(transcriptions)} existing transcriptions from checkpoint")
```

**Result:**
- When resuming, all 185 existing transcriptions are loaded
- Newly processed files (24) are added to this dict
- Timeline generation receives complete dict with all 209 files
- All voice messages display correctly with their transcriptions

## Issue 2: Settings Not Carried Over on Resume

### Root Cause

The checkpoint stores configuration settings (`checkpoint['config']`), but these were never restored when resuming.

**The Problem:**
- Line 1077-1082: Config is saved to checkpoint when first created
- When resuming, user clicks "Resume Processing" button
- Line 2360: `process_chat(uploaded_file, config, checkpoint=resume_checkpoint)`
- The `config` parameter comes from **current UI settings**, not from checkpoint
- User has to manually re-select same settings (transcription engine, LLM enabled, correction mode, etc.)

**What Happened:**
```python
# First run: User selected Voxtral + OpenAI + Message-by-message correction
# Settings saved to checkpoint['config']
# App crashed, user resumed
# UI shows default settings (not checkpoint settings)
# User must manually re-select all options â†’ frustrating and error-prone
```

### Fix Applied

**Location:** `app.py` lines 1088-1109

```python
# When resuming (checkpoint already exists)
else:
    # Resuming from existing checkpoint - restore critical config settings
    if 'config' in checkpoint and checkpoint['config']:
        saved_config = checkpoint['config']
        logger.info(f"Restoring config from checkpoint: {saved_config}")

        # Update current config with saved settings (for key processing parameters)
        if 'transcription_engine' in saved_config:
            config['transcription_engine'] = saved_config['transcription_engine']
        if 'use_llm' in saved_config:
            config['use_llm'] = saved_config['use_llm']
        if 'llm_provider' in saved_config:
            config['llm_provider'] = saved_config['llm_provider']
        if 'correction_mode' in saved_config:
            config['correction_mode'] = saved_config['correction_mode']

        status_text.info(
            f"ðŸ“‹ Restored settings from checkpoint:\n\n"
            f"- Engine: {saved_config.get('transcription_engine', 'N/A')}\n\n"
            f"- LLM: {saved_config.get('use_llm', False)}\n\n"
            f"- Mode: {saved_config.get('correction_mode', 'N/A')}"
        )
```

**Result:**
- Critical settings are restored from checkpoint automatically
- User sees info message showing what settings were restored
- Processing continues with same settings as original run
- Consistent results between interrupted and resumed processing

**Settings Restored:**
- `transcription_engine`: Voxtral vs Faster-Whisper
- `use_llm`: Whether LLM correction is enabled
- `llm_provider`: Which LLM provider (OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- `correction_mode`: Message-by-message vs full transcript

**Settings NOT Restored** (user can choose):
- Language setting
- Output format (markdown vs plain text)
- Date range filters
- Custom filename

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Timeline with Resumed Processing
1. Start processing a large chat (200+ files)
2. Stop after ~100 files (interrupt or force stop)
3. Restart app and resume processing
4. Verify final timeline shows ALL transcriptions correctly
5. Verify no "transcription failed" messages appear

### Test Case 2: Config Restoration
1. Start processing with specific settings:
   - Transcription engine: Voxtral
   - LLM correction: Enabled
   - LLM provider: OpenAI
   - Correction mode: Message-by-message
2. Stop after processing some files
3. Restart app and upload same file
4. Click "Resume Processing"
5. Verify status message shows restored settings
6. Verify processing continues with same settings
7. Verify final output matches expected format

### Test Case 3: Fresh Start vs Resume
1. Process same chat twice:
   - First time: Fresh start, complete successfully
   - Second time: Start fresh, interrupt, then resume
2. Compare outputs:
   - Should have same transcriptions
   - Should have same timeline format
   - Should have same correction results

## Summary

Both issues have been resolved:

âœ… **Timeline Issue:**
- Existing transcriptions are now loaded from checkpoint
- Timeline displays all voice messages correctly
- No more false "transcription failed" messages

âœ… **Config Issue:**
- Critical settings automatically restored from checkpoint
- User sees confirmation of restored settings
- Consistent processing between fresh and resumed runs
- Eliminates user error from manually re-selecting settings

## Files Modified

- `app.py` (Lines 1120-1122, 1088-1109)

---

## Additional Notes

**Why only restore certain settings?**
- Some settings (engine, LLM, correction mode) must be consistent for valid results
- Other settings (output format, filename) can safely vary between runs
- This approach balances consistency with user flexibility

**Transcriptions are safe:**
- All completed transcriptions are always saved in the checkpoint
- Even if timeline generation fails, transcriptions are preserved
- Can be recovered from checkpoint JSON file if needed

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Changes are backward compatible with existing checkpoints
- If checkpoint has no config field, code handles gracefully
- If checkpoint has empty transcriptions, code handles gracefully
